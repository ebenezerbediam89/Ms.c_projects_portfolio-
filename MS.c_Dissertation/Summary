# Background: 

The business environment of this new century has undertaken several
changes, creating more and more complexity and uncertainty. In this changing environment characterising the global economy, companies face strong competitive pressure
to do things better, faster and cheaper. Therefore, assessing the performance of organisations has always been of interest to management teams and researchers. The most
common tools used for this purpose are: BSC (Balance Scorecard), BEM (Business Excellence Model), KPI (Key Performance Indicators), Six Sigma, Capability Maturity
Model and DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis). The objective of this work was to evaluate
the performance of cameroonian companies, in order to help them face their multiple
challenges.

# Methods: 

This was a study based on a panel of 600 companies observed over 03
periods: 2006, 2009, 2016. As tools, we used stochastic frontier analysis to determine the
level of production efficiency as a function of input use; data was analysed in R version
4.2.3; description of the variables was done using mean +/- standard deviation(SD) or
median(Inter-quartile Range "IQR") where appropriated; frequencies and proportions
were used to describe qualitative data; in order to highlight the associated factors with
the good performance in terms of sales volume (dependent variable), we used panel data
estimators; performance indicators are used as a reference to identify gaps in business
process management.

Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models are a class of economic models that use actual economic data to estimate how an economy might react to changes in policy, technology or other external factors. Activities: analysis of the poverty and social impacts of a wide range of policies, including exogenous shocks (exchange rates, international prices, etc.), changes in taxes, subsidies and public spending (including changes in trade policies) and changes in the national economic and social structure (including technological change, asset redistribution, human resource capital formation).

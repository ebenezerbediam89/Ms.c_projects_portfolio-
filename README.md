# M.Sc. Project Portfolio

Hello!!!

Welcome to this portfolio. My name is Ebenezer Bediam Nonbo, and I am excited to have you here!

In this repository, you will come across several folders and sub-folders that contain the Master's programme in Mathematical Modelling in Economics and Finance and some of the projects we have worked on. The programme was quite varied and enabled me to develop practical skills in the use of macroeconomic models and the workings of the economy by mastering tools such as economic policy, monetary economics, the digital economy, market and corporate finance. Consolidation and practical application of mathematical tools such as dynamic optimisation, numerical analysis, stochastic processes, etc.

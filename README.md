# M.Sc. Project Portfolio

Hello!!!

Welcome to this portfolio. My name is Ebenezer Bediam Nonbo, and I am excited to have you here!

In this repository, you will come across several folders and sub-folders that contain the Master's programme in Mathematical Modelling in Economics and Finance and some of the projects we have worked on. The programme was quite varied and enabled me to develop practical skills in the use of macroeconomic models and the workings of the economy by mastering tools such as economic policy, monetary economics, the digital economy, market and corporate finance. Consolidation and practical application of mathematical tools such as dynamic optimisation, numerical analysis, stochastic processes, etc.

# Projects description: 

# Proj#01:Computable General Equilibrium (CGE)
Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models are a class of economic models that use actual economic data to estimate how an economy might react to changes in policy, technology or other external factors. Activities: analysis of the poverty and social impacts of a wide range of policies, including exogenous shocks (exchange rates, international prices, etc.), changes in taxes, subsidies and public spending (including changes in trade policies) and changes in the national economic and social structure (including technological change, asset redistribution, human resource capital formation).
Software(s): 
â€¢ GAMS, GEMPACK

# Proj#02:Introduction to macroeconomic modelling
Objective(s): Learn useful reflexes for modelling contemporary macroeconomic modelling (objectives of models, choice of methods, choice of variables and software, etc.); introduce two major groups of models used in central banks and international institutions: VARs and DSGEs (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium); to address questions useful for future research.
